# City Explorer

**Author**: Dasha Burgos

## Getting Started

Create an app with `react-create-app`

## Architecture

 The application is designed in React components were they are plug and play. React.js is used for the Components and styling. LocationIQ is used for API Key. CSS is also used for some styling. HTML placeholders are used for JavaScript DOM. Try and Catch blocks are used to render the data or errors depending what is sent from the backed. Axios is also used for the location API.
